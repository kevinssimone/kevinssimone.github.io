This is a logo for a sports team called “The Rovers”. The moniker is meant to be a play on the name of the Mars Rover, combining it with a loveable dog. Each of the logos in the package attempt to keep the space + dog theme going.



My angle:



The recent trend of wacky and borderline-cartoonish mascots being unveiled in various levels of professional sports has very much been on the rise. Minor league baseball, in particular, is known for taking big swings (no pun intended) with their brands, going an experimental and kid-friendly route. The design company, Brandiose, is the driving force behind many of those brands and they serve as a company that I really look up to.
