Aqua Affliction was the name of the 20-minute pop-up escape room event that was run and designed by myself and some fellow students in Brantford in November, 2019. Members of the community and escape room enthusiasts, alike, came down and attempted to escape a room created around the 2000 Walkerton water poisoning, wherein thousands were sickened by an E-Coli outbreak that was not caught by management. The Poster for the evnt has a few fun nuances on it, including a reimagined logo that harkens back to the city of Walkerton logo found on their water tower, which became a real image for the crisis. It eerily reads “We’d Love to have the Pleasure of your company”.



My Angle: 



Getting the chance to not only design a real-world escape room, but having people pay to play it right in front of me, was an absolute dream. I’ve loved puzzles and escape games for the majority of my life. With a knowledge base of UX and a dedication to understanding what players’ mindsets will be when they play, it was a fun challenge to balance historical accuracy, game mechanics, as well as the fun and challenging puzzling aspect.
