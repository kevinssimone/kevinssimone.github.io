This is the logo for a proposed cultural festival revolving around the South Pacific isles.



My Angle:



I was given the choice of any culture to highlight in this festival and really wanted to go with one that could serve as both a big shock for Canadians, while also see a bit of themselves in the culture. The South Pacific is known as a hot getaway destination, but there is so much to share beyond the white beaches and clear water (though those are certainly welcome!). Canada’s fascination with rugby has grown exponentially over the past few years, as well, which meshes perfectly with one of the Pacific islands’ favourite sports.
