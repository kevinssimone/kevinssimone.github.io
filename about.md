I'm a UX Designer from Waterloo, Ontario! My history with design has been a long one, which started with a fascination with sports logos at a very young age. I still keep many of the crudely-coloured paper "jerseys" for the seemingly endless amount of fake hockey leagues that I created. This branched into a love for graphic design, a skill that I've excelled at. Using a wide variety of tools, from Microsoft Paint, to Powerpoint, to Inkscape, to the likes of Affinity Designer and Illustrator that I use now

As much as I love a flashy design, I've learned over and over that fuction trumps form every time. That's why I've made it my mission as a UX designer to develop practical, intuitive solutions.
